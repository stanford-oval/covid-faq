Are COVID-19 vaccines being held to the same safety standards as other vaccines?,"Yes.

COVID-19 vaccines are being held to the same safety standards as all other vaccines in the U.S.

These vaccines were reviewed by the federal government and the state of California to ensure that they are safe and effective."
Are COVID-19 vaccines safe?,"Yes.

All COVID-19 vaccines were tested with tens of thoussands of volunteers of different ages, races, and ethnicities to ensure safety and effectiveness before release."
Are mRNA vaccines safe?,"Yes. mRNA vaccines have been in development for years and have been proven to be safe and effective. They build immune protection by copying the shape of the virus without actually including a piece of the virus itself.


mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid and can most easily be described as instructions for how to make a protein, or even just a piece of a protein.


mRNA is not able to alter our genetic makeup (DNA). The mRNA from a COVID-19 vaccine does not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. Instead, COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA work with the body’s natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease."
Are the county operated mass vaccination sites ADA compliant?,"Yes, all of the County Health System vaccination sites are ADA compliant."
Can children be vaccinated?,"No. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is only authorized for administration in patients aged 16 years and older. The Moderna and Janssen/J&J vaccines are only authorized in patients aged 18 years and older. Clinical trials are underway for children, but at this point there is no vaccine approved for children."
Can I choose which COVID-19 vaccine I get?,"The best vaccine for you is the one you can get first, unless your doctor has a speciifc recommendation for you based on your personal history.  All three vaccines are equally effective at preventing severe COVID, and the sooner you get protected, the sooner you will be helping prevent generation and spread of variants.  "
Can I choose which vaccine I receive?,"Depending on where you receive the vaccine, you may or may not be given a choice of options. Because all authorized vaccines are safe and effective, it is important that you are vaccinated with the first vaccine that is offered to you to ensure that you are protected as soon as possible."
Can I contract COVID-19 after I'm vaccinated?,"We have strong evidence that being vaccinated will prevent you from getting severely ill and dying from COVID-19. There may be a small chance that you can still get an asymptomatic infection or mild illness, but growing evidence suggests that being vaccinated makes this possibility much less likely than if you were never vaccinated.

It’s important to keep in mind that it typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it is possible a person could contract COVID-19 shortly after vaccination and get sick because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection."
Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?,No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.
Can I get vaccinated if I have an underlying medical condition?,"Yes!

Patients with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of having severe COVID-19 illness, and the vaccine can offer protection.

Talk with your health care provider."
Could I have an allergic reaction?,"Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are extremely rare. The FDA says the authorized COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe for people with common food or environmental allergies.


CDC recommends that people get vaccinated even if they have a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectable medications—such as food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex allergies. People with a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of severe allergic reactions may also get vaccinated.


If you have had an immediate allergic reaction — even if it was not severe — to a vaccine or injectable therapy for another disease, ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. Your doctor will help you decide if it is safe for you to get vaccinated.


All people who get a COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored on site. People who have had severe allergic reactions or who have had any type of immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after getting the vaccine. All other people should be monitored for at least 15 minutes after getting the vaccine."
Did developing the vaccines so quickly compromise safety?,"No. None of the normal steps in the vaccine vetting process were skipped in order to quickly develop these vaccines. Rapid development was possible because:

1. manufacturing started while the clinical trials were still underway (normally manufacturing doesn’t begin until after completion of the trials);
2. mRNA vaccines are faster to produce than other kinds of vaccines,
3. FDA and CDC was and is prioritizing the review process for COVID-19 vaccines; and
4. researchers used existing clinical trial networks to quickly begin conducting the COVID vaccine trials."
Did the clinical trials include people like me?,"Researchers made sure that the trials included adults of diverse backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. They collaborated with faith leaders, community organizations, and health clinics to reach volunteers from many different walks of life across the United States."
Do I have to show proof of citizenship to get a vaccine?,No. CDC does not require United States citizenship for individuals to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
Do I need 1 shot or 2 shots?,"It depends on which vaccine you get. Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given in two shots, one at a time and spaced apart. The second shot of the Moderna vaccine should be given 28 days after your first shot, and the second shot of the Pfizer vaccine should be given 21 days after your first shot. The different types of vaccine are not interchangeable, so your doctor or pharmacist will help make sure you get the same type of vaccine for both shots if applicable.

The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine only requires one shot. As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. 

The vaccines may work in slightly different ways, but all types of the vaccines will help protect you. It takes time for your body to build immunity after vaccination, so you might not get full protection until two weeks after your final shot for two-dose vaccines.

"
Do I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others if I have gotten 2 doses of the vaccine?,"For now, fully vaccinated people can gather indoors without physical distancing or wearing masks with:
- Other people who are fully vaccinated
- Unvaccinated people from one other household, unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Until more is known, fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from other people in other settings, like when they are in public or visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households."
Do I still have to wear a mask?,"Yes. Until enough Americans are vaccinated, it’s important to continue to wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with, avoid crowds, and wash your hands frequently.

Researchers are working to understand whether you can still carry the virus and spread it to others if you’ve had the vaccine and are protected from getting sick.

Continuing to wear a mask helps protect others while we learn more about how COVID-19 spreads. It also helps protect people who are not able to get vaccinated — such as pregnant women or young children."
Do I still need to follow the public health orders and directives after I have been fully vaccinated?,"Yes. At this time, unless a public health order or directive says otherwise, a person’s vaccination status does not exempt them from State and County public health orders and directives. The County will evaluate new data and evidence regarding the effects of vaccination as they come in, and may adjust this policy in the future."
Do I still need to mask and social distance after getting vaccinated?,"We are still learning how the vaccine affects whether people can still transmit COVID-19 to others. It may be possible that a vaccinated person can still carry the virus and infect others, even if that person does not appear to be sick.

That’s why, until enough Americans are vaccinated to fight off COVID-19, we will need to keep wearing masks, stay 6 feet apart from people we don’t live with, avoid crowds, and wash our hands frequently."
Do I still need to quarantine after being exposed to someone with COVID-19 if I've been fully vaccinated?,"No, if you meet all of the following criteria:

- Your exposure occurred after 14 days and less than 90 days after the completion of your vaccine series
- You do not have any COVID-19 symptoms
- You are not an inpatient or resident in a healthcare setting or facility"
Do I still need to wear a mask if I get vaccinated?,"Yes.

We all need to do our part to stay safe while we wait for vaccines to be widely available, and for a sufficient portion of the population to be vaccinated.

This means we all need to work together to keep our risk of COVID-19 low."
Do vaccines protect against new variants that have surfaced in the US?,"Current data suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines recommended in the United States provide protection against new forms or variants of the COVID-19 virus. For this reason, COVID-19 vaccines are an essential tool to protect people against COVID-19, including against new variants. CDC recommends getting vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is available to you."
How are COVID-19 vaccines authorized and approved for use?,"Researchers began developing vaccines for COVID-19 in January 2020, based on decades of understanding immune response and how vaccines work. Thousands of volunteers participated in clinical trials that started that spring, making sure we can trust the vaccines to be safe and effective.

Based on the results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized multiple vaccines for public use. Recommended vaccines have met the agency’s rigorous and science-based standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness.

COVID-19 is a new virus requiring new vaccines, but vaccines have been saving lives and protecting us for centuries. Now, medical experts believe COVID-19 vaccines can help us move forward in our everyday lives."
How are vaccines tested for safety?,"Every vaccine must go through rigorous testing and inspection to ensure it is safe.
Vaccines for COVID-19 followed a 3-phase process where there are several stages before FDA authorization:

Phase 1: The vaccine is tested in a small number of generally healthy adults, usually between 20 and 80 people. It’s evaluated for safety, dosage, and any side effects. Experts also look at what type of immune response is created.

Phase 2: If there are no safety concerns from Phase I studies, the vaccine is given in various dosages to hundreds of adults who may have a variety of health issues and come from different backgrounds to make sure it is safe. These studies provide additional safety information on common short-term side effects and risks, examine the relationship between the dose given and the immune response, and may provide initial information regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Phase 3: Experts broaden the study to include thousands of adults, from a variety of ages and backgrounds. They see how many people who got the vaccine were protected from the disease, compared to those who received a placebo.

After a vaccine is authorized by the FDA and made available to the public, experts continue to keep track of data to help ensure safety and help us learn more about questions like whether vaccinated people can still get infected without having symptoms."
How are you accommodating individuals who cannot stand in line very long?,"Each vaccination clinic has a special workflow to ensure individuals with disabilities can safely and comfortably access the site. Each site has designated parking for anyone with mobility challenges. Wheelchairs are available as needed onsite to provide access to registration, vaccination, and observation areas to minimize distances to walk between stations."
How can I prove my eligibility at a County Health System vaccination site?,"To demonstrate eligibility at County Health System vaccination sites, you should bring a document showing that you live, work, or attend school in Santa Clara County.

Please note that the requirements at vaccination sites run by other providers, such as Kaiser, Stanford, or Palo Alto Medical Foundation, may be different.

The County understands some individuals do not have an updated photo ID or traditional paystub and will accept any reasonable document. For convenience, below are examples of documents the County will accept."
How do COVID-19 vaccines keep us safe?,"Vaccines are the best protection we have against many serious illnesses. They protect us from diseases by teaching our immune systems how to fight viruses and infections — without actually getting sick from the disease.


COVID-19 can have serious and life-threatening complications, which is why it’s important for everyone who’s eligible to get vaccinated. If you’re not sure, ask your doctor if you should be immunized against COVID-19."
How do I cancel an appointment with the County Health System?,"Right now, the way to cancel an appointment is the call Valley Connections at 408-970-2000.  We are working on additional methods to cancel appointments and expect to have more options soon."
How do I get a vaccine?,"The Stanford COVID Genie (https://genie.stanford.edu, SMS: 2542820431) helps you find available vaccines in your neighborhood. You can also find vaccines at VaccineFinder.org."
How do the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines compare?,Both vaccines provide 94-95% effectiveness at preventing severe illness after receiving both doses.
How do these vaccines protect me?,"When we get a vaccine, it activates our immune response. This helps our bodies learn to fight off the virus without the danger of an actual infection. If we are exposed to the virus in the future, our immune system “remembers” how to fight it.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA. mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus — they give our bodies “instructions” for how to make and fight the harmless spike-shaped proteins that will protect against a COVID-19 infection. While these vaccines use new technology, researchers have been studying them for decades.
"
How do vaccines get approved or authorized?,"Vaccines are approved or authorized by the FDA, which sets strict standards for clinical trials and rigorously evaluates scientific data submitted by vaccine developers.


In December 2020, the FDA authorized two versions of COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) for the American public. A third (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen)was added in February 2021. As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution.


Doctors and medical experts with many years of experience regulating vaccines evaluated information about the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality of the vaccines prior to making their decision. They determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccines outweigh any known or potential risks.


After a vaccine is authorized by the FDA and made available to the public, experts continue to keep track of data to help ensure safety and help us learn more about questions like whether vaccinated people can still get infected without having symptoms."
How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?,"Very effective. Clinical trials involving tens of thousands of individuals have demonstrated that the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen (also known as Johnson & Johnson) vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19."
How long does a COVID-19 vaccine last?,"Immunization against COVID-19 will help protect you for the near future, but it’s still not clear how long the protection will last. We will have a clearer picture of how long immunity lasts in years to come when we have collected more data. "
How long does it take for the vaccine to take effect?,Starting from 2 weeks after the second dose (Pfizer/Moderna) or the single does (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson)
How long does protection from a COVID-19 vaccine last?,"We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice.
"
How many doses of COVID-19 vaccine will I need to get?,"To get the most protection:
- Two Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart.
- Two Moderna vaccine doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart.
You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.
However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary.. "
How much does it cost?,"COVID-19 vaccine is provided at 100% no cost to recipients. The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status. No one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay a vaccine administration fee."
How was it determined that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe?,"All authorized COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers of different ages, races, and ethnicities to ensure their safety and effectiveness. The FDA, CDC, and ACIP have all evaluated the trial information and determined the vaccines to be safe, effective, and of high quality. These groups are continuing to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to make sure even very rare side effects are identified and appropriate precautions are taken."
How well do they work?,"So far, the data on the vaccines show that they are extremely effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. Clinical trials have been carried out on several COVID-19 vaccines to assess how effective they are. Other clinical trials are ongoing. The FDA has authorized some vaccines for use by the general public, after data from their trials showed them to be highly effective.

The vaccines will continue to be monitored closely in real-world conditions once they’ve been given to people, to ensure continued safety and to keep learning about things like whether you can still transmit the virus even if the vaccine protects you from being infected."
How were these vaccines made so quickly?,"The science behind the breakthrough had a head start. Researchers had already made progress developing vaccines for other types of coronaviruses: they applied lessons learned after the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2012 MERS outbreak. They also learned a lot from creating a vaccine for Ebola — which isn’t a coronavirus but has taught us more about viruses.

Many researchers and medical experts have come together to develop the vaccine while still meeting the FDA’s rigorous requirements for safety and effectiveness. While regulators have streamlined some steps in the vaccine authorization process, the vaccines still needed to meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.
"
How will I feel afterwards?,"It’s normal to experience some mild discomfort following a vaccine. This means it’s working and creating an immune response in your body.

You may feel soreness or experience some swelling in your arm. You may also feel tired, have a headache, fever, or chills. These symptoms do not mean you have COVID-19 — it’s not possible to get COVID-19 from the vaccine.

These side effects may impact your daily activities, but they shouldn’t last more than 2-3 days. If they continue or get worse, call your doctor, nurse, or clinic.

Even if you have these types of effects after your first shot, it’s important to make sure you get the second one, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get a second shot. Ask your doctor if you have questions. Your body takes time to build immunity. You may not be fully protected against COVID-19 until 1-2 weeks after your final shot.

In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:
- If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours
- If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days
- If you develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within the first three weeks.
- If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions."
"I don't have a primary care doctor or insurance, where will I get my vaccine when I'm eligible?","Under the County’s ‘no wrong door’ policy, all providers (with the exception of the VA) will vaccinate eligible patients regardless of your healthcare provider or insurance. See above to check your eligibility and the latest options for how to book an appointment for your vaccination."
"I don't have insurance, can I get vaccine?","The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status."
"If I am pregnant or trying to get pregnant, can I still receive the vaccine?","Yes. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for you and your baby.

- The vaccines protect expectant mothers. Individuals who get COVID-19 while pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness. The vaccine will keep you safer.
- If you are trying to get pregnant, the vaccine is also recommended for you. There is no evidence it affects fertility.
- COVID-19 vaccine is safe for the developing baby. Research suggests that getting vaccinated both protects mothers and also passes on antibodies to babies that better protect them.
- Vaccination helps avoid pregnancy complications. People who get COVID-19 are at increased risk of pre-term birth.
Talk to your doctor for more information about vaccines and pregnancy."
"If I am pregnant, can I get a COVID-19 vaccine?","Yes, if you are pregnant, you might choose to be vaccinated. Based on how COVID-19 vaccines work, experts think they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people because these vaccines have not been widely studied in pregnant people. Systems are in place to continue to monitor vaccine safety, and so far, they have not identified any specific safety concerns for pregnant people. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway or planned.
While a conversation with your healthcare provider might be helpful, it is not required before to vaccination. "
"If I have a medical condition, can I still receive the vaccine? What if I am immunocompromised?","Patients with underlying medical conditions can receive the vaccine. In fact, it is important that this group be vaccinated because they are at increased risk of having severe COVID-19 illness. Immunocompromised individuals (for example, persons living with HIV, transplant recipients, and those taking immunosuppressive medications) may receive the COVID-19 vaccines. However, because sufficient data is not yet available to establish vaccine efficacy in this population, immunocompromised individuals should be counseled by their healthcare provider on the potential for reduced immune response to the vaccine and the need to continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19 even after getting vaccinated."
"If I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine?","Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. 
If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine."
"If I have an underlying condition, can I get a COVID-19 vaccine?",People with underlying medical conditions can receive a COVID-19 vaccine as long as they have not had an immediate or severe allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
"If I have been exposed to COVID-19 in the past, do I still need to get vaccinated?",Yes. The CDC recommends that all persons who have been exposed to COVID-19 in the past be vaccinated. Individuals should complete their quarantine period prior to visiting a vaccination site.
"If I received my first dose of vaccine outside of Santa Clara County, how can I receive my second dose?","If there are appointments available, eligible individuals who received their first vaccination dose in another county, may register to receive their second dose in Santa Clara County. To make sure that you are scheduled into a site carrying the correct manufacturer for your second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), please call (408) 970-2000 to schedule your appointment. Online scheduling is only available for first dose appointments."
"If I've had COVID-19 in the past and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated?","Yes. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had a COVID-19 infection. If you were treated for COVID-19 with intravenous monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID vaccine. Otherwise, you can receive a vaccine dose after you have recovered from acute illness and have completed your isolation period. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatment you received or if you have more questions about getting a vaccine. Experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Note: Some healthcare organizations may prioritize for vaccination those who have not had a previous infection in the prior 90 days."
"If vaccines are coming, do I still have to wear a mask, keep a distance, and avoid gatherings, especially when indoors?","Yes. We all need to do our part to stay safe while we wait for vaccines to be widely available, and for a sufficient portion of the population to be vaccinated. Our county, like everyone else, has received a limited supply to start. More will come over time. This means we all need to work together to keep our risk of COVID-19 low. We can do that by protecting ourselves and others by wearing face masks, keeping our distance, and not gathering in groups, especially when indoors."
If vaccines work why do I still have to wear masks?,"Until enough Americans are vaccinated, it’s important to continue to wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with, avoid crowds, and wash your hands frequently.

Researchers are working to understand whether you can still carry the virus and spread it to others if you’ve had the vaccine and are protected from getting sick.

Continuing to wear a mask helps protect others while we learn more about how COVID-19 spreads. It also helps protect people who are not able to get vaccinated — such as pregnant women or young children."
My family member lives in a nursing home or other long-term care facility. When will he or she be vaccinated?,"The federal government has created a program under which CVS and Walgreens are responsible for vaccinating residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States.  Most of these facilities in Santa Clara County are participating in this federal program, which began vaccinations in our county on December 28, 2020. The few facilities in Santa Clara County that chose not to enroll in this program will have residents and staff vaccinated through the County and its partners."
Should I be concerned if I or a loved one received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine?,"No. Any risk to you is extremely low.

On April 13, 2021, the County of Santa Clara and other healthcare providers paused the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, also known as Janssen, as recommended out of an abundance of caution by federal and state authorities. The federal government and the vaccine manufacturer are investigating rare health incidents in 6 people living in other places in the country out of the nearly 7 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered nationwide to see if they might be connected to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. This is a part of the federal government system set up to keep medications safe.

If you were vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than a month ago, any risk to you is very low. If you got the vaccine within the last few weeks, any risk is also extremely low. The 6 people who experienced the rare health incident in other places had symptoms 6-13 days after vaccination. These symptoms included severe headache, severe abdominal pain, severe leg pain, and shortness of breath. If you have questions or are worried that you might have these symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider. It is important to remember that the vaccines were studied with tens of thousands of volunteers of different ages, races, and backgrounds and have been safely administered to millions of people nationwide. Studies have found that serious side effects are very rare, and the vaccines are very safe."
Should I get vaccinated if I had COVID-19 in the past and recovered?,"Yes!

You need the vaccine even if you have had COVID-19 in the past.

People who have been previously infected can be infected again, and the vaccine may provide additional protection."
Should I get vaccinated if I have been exposed to COVID-19 in the past?,"Yes!

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have been exposed to COVID-19 in the past be vaccinated."
"Should I still get tested, wear a mask, and avoid indoor gatherings and breakrooms if I've been fully vaccinated?","Yes. At this time, the Public Health Department’s recommendations for testing and other recommendations apply even if you’ve been fully vaccinated. Regular testing for frontline workers and others with exposure to the public continues to be particularly important. Public Health will adjust its recommendations in the future based on new data and evidence as they come in."
Was the vaccine rushed?,"No.

The COVID vaccines are being held to the same safety standards as all other vaccines. They were developed quickly because they were highly prioritized.

Like First Class shipping, your package isn't thrown together and tossed at your doorstep. It still goes through the same channels and protocols, just at an accelerated place to meet the need."
What are the differences in the vaccines?,"All authorized COVID-19 vaccines provide significant protection from serious illness and hospitalization. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.

The Moderna vaccine is recommended for people age 18+ and includes 2 shots spaced 28 days apart. It is a messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 94% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides significant protection against serious illness.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is recommended for people age 16+ and include 2 shots spaced 21 days apart. It is an mRNA vaccine. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides significant protection against serious illness.

As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine is delivered in one shot only. It is a viral vector vaccine. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 72% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides significant protection against serious illness."
What are the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines?,"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine includes the following ingredients: mRNA, lipids, potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: mRNA, lipids, tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose."
What are the most common side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?,"After getting vaccinated, you might have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. Common side effects are pain, redness, and swelling in the arm where you received the shot, as well as tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea throughout the rest of the body. These side effects could affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days.  You can treat symptoms after vaccination with tylenol or ibuprofen.  If you have severe symptoms, or they persist beyond 72 hours, call your doctor.  If you had Johnson and Johnson within the past three weeks, call your doctor immediately if you develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath."
What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?,"Vaccine recipients commonly experience mild to moderate side effects that occur within the first three days of vaccination and resolve within 1-3 days of onset. These are normal signs that your body is building protection. Common side effects include mild to moderate pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site and/or mild to moderate flu-like symptoms (for example, fever, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches). Serious side effects are very rare."
What can I do when I’m fully vaccinated?,"Fully vaccinated people (full immunity takes ~2 weeks after your final shot) can gather indoors, without physical distancing or wearing masks, with:

- Other people who are fully vaccinated
- Unvaccinated people from one other household, unless any of the people in that household has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

If you’ve been around someone who has COVID-19 after you’ve been vaccinated, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.
- BUT, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don’t have symptoms.

Until more is known, fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from other people in other settings, like when they are in public or visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households."
What if I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?,"As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. Doctors and other health experts are reviewing the specifics and will continue to provide the latest information.


CDC and FDA have noted that adverse events appear to be extremely rare. As of April 12, nearly 7 million J&J doses have been administered, and CDC and FDA are investigating 6 cases of an extremely rare type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine. People who have received the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine within the past three weeks who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath should contact their healthcare provider.


The CDC and FDA continue to recommend the Pfizer and Moderna versions of COVID-19 vaccines, and the United States has already secured enough Pfizer and Moderna doses for 300 million Americans."
What if I have an underlying health condition?,"People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, vaccination is especially important for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, because they are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Ask your doctor if you have specific questions.

People who have autoimmune conditions and who have previously had Guillan-Barre syndrome or Bell’s palsy may receive a COVID-19 vaccine."
What is the update on the Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?,"Regulators have paused the use of Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution, effective Tuesday, April 13. People who have received the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine within the past three weeks who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath should seek medical care right away. It will hopefully be back in use soon, possibly with limitations or recommendations. "
What type of vaccine will I get?,"While supplies are limited, if you are in one of the groups recommended to take the vaccine, you will need to get whichever vaccine is available in your area. It’s possible that in the coming months, as production increases and more vaccines get approved for use, that people will have options for which shot to get.

The bottom line is that every vaccine that is recommended by FDA and CDC has been thoroughly tested and found to be effective and safe.

You’ll get a card or fact sheet at your vaccination site that will tell you about the vaccine and help you understand the details. Your card will tell you which kind of vaccine you get and when to get the second dose, if applicable."
What types of vaccines are there?,"Moderna and Pfizer are Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and Johnson and Johnson is a viral vector vaccine. Both vaccines teach our bodies how to protect us from the viruses that contain them. They produce antibodies, which are part of our body’s immune system defenses, that fight off the virus if it enters our bodies. It’s important to note that none of these vaccines affect our DNA in any way. "
What will it cost to get a COVID-19 vaccine?,"COVID-19 vaccines are available at no cost, but they are only available to eligible individuals."
What’s it like to get vaccinated against COVID-19?,"Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will be a lot like getting any other shot.

When you go in, you’ll be given a fact sheet that tells you more about the specific vaccine you’re being offered.

When do the vaccines take full effect?,Starting from two weeks after receiving the second dose for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna or the single dose Janssen/Johnson & Johnson.
Where will most people get vaccinated when they become eligible?,"Like other vaccines, many people will receive COVID-19 vaccination through their primary care provider. All large health systems including Kaiser, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, the County’s hospitals and clinics, Stanford Healthcare, and some smaller community clinics have been allocated vaccine to vaccinate their patients as they become eligible. Other entities like the large pharmacy chains (for example, CVS, Rite Aid) are also beginning to offer COVID-19 vaccination to eligible members of the public."
Who determines how many doses of vaccine are available in Santa Clara County?,"The State of California sets the number of doses of vaccine that go to each county. The County Public Health Department is then directed to apportion a subset of these doses to healthcare providers in the County, according to directions from the state and federal government. Some other organizations with facilities in Santa Clara County get additional supplies of vaccine from the state or federal government. These organizations include federal government agencies and large health care systems that operate in more than one county (including Kaiser and Sutter/Palo Alto Medical Foundation). Large retail pharmacies receive additional supplies."

Individuals with a history of allergic reactions that are not related to vaccines or injectable therapies may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. For example, people who are allergic to food, pets, venom, pollen, latex, or oral medications should get vaccinated against COVID-19.

A very few people may be allergic to a component of one of the vaccines. Those individuals are usually recommended to receive a different type of COVID-19 vaccine. For example, people who cannot receive the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines may be recommended to receive the J&J vaccine. If you know you are allergic to an ingredient in some of the vaccines, talk to a special kind of doctor called an allergist-immunologist before receiving the vaccine.

If you had a severe reaction to a different vaccine (not COVID-19) or injectable medication in the past, also talk to your doctor before getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

Individuals who are currently sick with COVID-19 disease should not receive the vaccine until the person has recovered from acute illness and criteria have been met to discontinue isolation.

Individuals who received passive antibody (monoclonal antibodies or convalescent serum) as treatment for COVID-19 should defer vaccination for at least 90 days after antibody therapy."
Why is there more than one type of COVID-19 vaccine?,"Many teams of medical experts around the world have helped in the search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine — including many of the leading doctors here in the United States.

Having multiple vaccines in development and production is crucial so that vaccination programs can be rolled out in many different countries at the same time, reaching as many people as possible.
"
Why should I get vaccinated?,"Getting immunized against COVID-19 will keep most people from getting sick. Even in a rare case where one does catch the virus, the vaccine will likely prevent you from becoming seriously ill.

Protecting yourself also protects the people around you, like those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 or those who can’t get vaccinated — like infants, or people with weakened immune systems from things like chemotherapy for cancer."
Will I be immune from COVID-19 if I already had it?,"You need the vaccine even if you had COVID-19 in the past.
