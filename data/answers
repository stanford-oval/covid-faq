CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution, effective Tuesday, April 13. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will hold its second emergency meeting to discuss J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine on April 23, 2021. People who have received the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine within the past three weeks who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath should seek medical care right away.
---
You should get any COVID-19 vaccine that is available when you are eligible. Do not wait for a specific brand. All currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and CDC does not recommend one vaccine over another.
---
After getting vaccinated, you might have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. Common side effects are pain, redness, and swelling in the arm where you received the shot, as well as tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea throughout the rest of the body. These side effects could affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Learn more about what to expect after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
---
Yes, if you are pregnant, you might choose to be vaccinated. Based on how COVID-19 vaccines work, experts think they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people because these vaccines have not been widely studied in pregnant people. Systems are in place to continue to monitor vaccine safety, and so far, they have not identified any specific safety concerns for pregnant people. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway or planned.

You might want to have a conversation with your healthcare provider to help you decide whether to get vaccinated. While a conversation with your healthcare provider might be helpful, it is not required before to vaccination. Learn more about vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

If you are pregnant and have received a COVID-19 vaccine, we encourage you to enroll in v-safe, CDC’s smartphone-based tool that provides personalized health check-ins after vaccination. A v-safe pregnancy registry has been established to gather information on the health of pregnant people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine.
---
We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice.

Experts are working to learn more about both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
---
It depends. For now, fully vaccinated people can gather indoors without physical distancing or wearing masks with:
- Other people who are fully vaccinated
- Unvaccinated people from one other household, unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Until more is known, fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from other people in other settings, like when they are in public or visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households.
---
Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. Learn more about why getting vaccinated is a safer way to build protection than getting infected.

If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

Experts are still learning more about how long vaccines protect against COVID-19 in real-world conditions. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
---
Vaccine ingredients can vary by manufacturer. To learn more about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see
- Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
- Information about the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
- Information about the Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine
---
The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status.

COVID-19 vaccination providers cannot:
- Charge you for the vaccine
- Charge you directly for any administration fees, copays, or coinsurance
- Deny vaccination to anyone who does not have health insurance coverage, is underinsured, or is out of network
- Charge an office visit or other fee to the recipient if the only service provided is a COVID-19 vaccination
- Require additional services in order for a person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; however, additional healthcare services can be provided at the same time and billed as appropriate

COVID-19 vaccination providers can:
- Seek appropriate reimbursement from the recipient’s plan or program (e.g., private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid) for a vaccine administration fee
  - However, providers cannot charge the vaccine recipient the balance of the bill
- Seek reimbursement for uninsured vaccine recipients from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s COVID-19 Uninsured Program
---
The number of doses needed depends on which vaccine you receive. To get the most protection:
- Two Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart.
- Two Moderna vaccine doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart.
- Johnson & Johnsons Jansen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine requires only one dose.

If you receive a vaccine that requires two doses, you should get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary.. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.
---
People with underlying medical conditions can receive a COVID-19 vaccine as long as they have not had an immediate or severe allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination considerations for people with underlying medical conditions. Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
---
No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.
---
Researchers began developing vaccines for COVID-19 in January 2020, based on decades of understanding immune response and how vaccines work. Thousands of volunteers participated in clinical trials that started that spring, making sure we can trust the vaccines to be safe and effective.

Based on the results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized multiple vaccines for public use Recommended vaccines have met the agency’s rigorous and science-based standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness.

COVID-19 is a new virus requiring new vaccines, but vaccines have been saving lives and protecting us for centuries. Now, medical experts believe COVID-19 vaccines can help us move forward in our everyday lives.
---
Every vaccine must go through rigorous testing and inspection to ensure it is safe.

Vaccines for COVID-19 followed a 3-phase process where there are several stages before FDA authorization:

Phase 1: The vaccine is tested in a small number of generally healthy adults, usually between 20 and 80 people. It’s evaluated for safety, dosage, and any side effects. Experts also look at what type of immune response is created.

Phase 2: If there are no safety concerns from Phase I studies, the vaccine is given in various dosages to hundreds of adults who may have a variety of health issues and come from different backgrounds to make sure it is safe. These studies provide additional safety information on common short-term side effects and risks, examine the relationship between the dose given and the immune response, and may provide initial information regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Phase 3: Experts broaden the study to include thousands of adults, from a variety of ages and backgrounds. They see how many people who got the vaccine were protected from the disease, compared to those who received a placebo.

After a vaccine is authorized by the FDA and made available to the public, experts continue to keep track of data to help ensure safety and help us learn more about questions like whether vaccinated people can still get infected without having symptoms.
---
Vaccines are approved or authorized by the FDA, which sets strict standards for clinical trials and rigorously evaluates scientific data submitted by vaccine developers.

In December 2020, the FDA authorized two versions of COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) for the American public. A third (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen)was added in February 2021. As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution.

Doctors and medical experts with many years of experience regulating vaccines evaluated information about the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality of the vaccines prior to making their decision. They determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccines outweigh any known or potential risks.

After a vaccine is authorized by the FDA and made available to the public, experts continue to keep track of data to help ensure safety and help us learn more about questions like whether vaccinated people can still get infected without having symptoms.
---
Researchers made sure that the trials included adults of diverse backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. They collaborated with faith leaders, community organizations, and health clinics to reach volunteers from many different walks of life across the United States.

Medical experts and doctors want to make sure the vaccines work safely and effectively for as many people as possible. People may respond differently to vaccines based on factors like age, gender, and health conditions — so it is important to have a diverse group of participants in clinical trials.

COVID-19 has hit hard in the Black and Hispanic communities. Historically, these populations haven’t always been included in clinical research, but with COVID-19 vaccines researchers made sure volunteers included people of color, as well as people over the age of 65 who are at higher risk of complications from the virus.
---
The science behind the breakthrough had a head start. Researchers had already made progress developing vaccines for other types of coronaviruses: they applied lessons learned after the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2012 MERS outbreak. They also learned a lot from creating a vaccine for Ebola — which isn’t a coronavirus but has taught us more about viruses.

The rapid spread of COVID-19 made developing these vaccines an international priority, unlocking billions of dollars in funding to ensure safety while moving with urgency to save lives.

Many researchers and medical experts have come together to develop the vaccine while still meeting the FDA’s rigorous requirements for safety and effectiveness. While regulators have streamlined some steps in the vaccine authorization process, the vaccines still needed to meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.

After a vaccine is authorized by the FDA and made available to the public, experts continue to keep track of data to help ensure safety and help us learn more about questions like whether vaccinated people can still get infected without having symptoms.
---
Vaccines are the best protection we have against many serious illnesses. They protect us from diseases by teaching our immune systems how to fight viruses and infections — without actually getting sick from the disease.

COVID-19 can have serious and life-threatening complications, which is why it’s important for everyone who’s eligible to get vaccinated. If you’re not sure, ask your doctor if you should be immunized against COVID-19.
---
When we get a vaccine, it activates our immune response. This helps our bodies learn to fight off the virus without the danger of an actual infection. If we are exposed to the virus in the future, our immune system “remembers” how to fight it.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA. mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus — they give our bodies “instructions” for how to make and fight the harmless spike-shaped proteins that will protect against a COVID-19 infection. While these vaccines use new technology, researchers have been studying them for decades.

The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine is a viral vector vaccine and also does not contain a live virus. It uses a harmless adenovirus to create a spike protein that the immune system responds to, creating antibodies to protect against COVID-19. As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. Doctors and other health experts are reviewing the specifics and will continue to provide the latest information.
---
Getting immunized against COVID-19 will keep most people from getting sick. Even in a rare case where one does catch the virus, the vaccine will likely prevent you from becoming seriously ill.

Protecting yourself also protects the people around you, like those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 or those who can’t get vaccinated — like infants, or people with weakened immune systems from things like chemotherapy for cancer.

We are still learning how the vaccine affects whether people can still transmit COVID-19 to others. It may be possible that a vaccinated person can still carry the virus and infect others, even if that person does not appear to be sick.

That’s why, until enough Americans are vaccinated to fight off COVID-19, we will need to keep wearing masks, stay 6 feet apart from people we don’t live with, avoid crowds, and wash our hands frequently.
---
Immunization against COVID-19 will help protect you for the near future, but it’s still not clear how long the protection will last. We will have a clearer picture of how long immunity lasts in years to come when we have collected more data. Both natural immunity and immunity from the vaccine are important ways to fight COVID-19 that experts are trying to learn more about, and places like the CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
---
People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, vaccination is especially important for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, because they are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Ask your doctor if you have specific questions.

People who have autoimmune conditions and who have previously had Guillan-Barre syndrome or Bell’s palsy may receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
---
Many teams of medical experts around the world have helped in the search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine — including many of the leading doctors here in the United States.

Having multiple vaccines in development and production is crucial so that vaccination programs can be rolled out in many different countries at the same time, reaching as many people as possible.

Hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have already been distributed and hundreds of millions more are in production. New vaccine candidates are also in development which may provide more options, as well as additional quantities for the American people.
---
Many vaccines work with harmless pieces of the spike-shaped proteins on the outer shell of the virus, instead of the entire virus. These proteins aren’t infectious — our immune system recognizes that the virus’ proteins in the vaccine don’t belong in our bodies and learns how to fight them off.

Both Messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector vaccines teach our bodies how to protect us from the viruses that contain them. They produce antibodies, which are part of our body’s immune system defenses, that fight off the virus if it enters our bodies. It’s important to note that none of these vaccines affect our DNA in any way.
---
So far, the data on the vaccines show that they are extremely effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. Clinical trials have been carried out on several COVID-19 vaccines to assess how effective they are. Other clinical trials are ongoing. The FDA has authorized some vaccines for use by the general public, after data from their trials showed them to be highly effective.

The vaccines will continue to be monitored closely in real-world conditions once they’ve been given to people, to ensure continued safety and to keep learning about things like whether you can still transmit the virus even if the vaccine protects you from being infected.
---
All authorized COVID-19 vaccines provide significant protection from serious illness and hospitalization. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.

The Moderna vaccine is recommended for people age 18+ and includes 2 shots spaced 28 days apart. It is a messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 94% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides significant protection against serious illness.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is recommended for people age 16+ and include 2 shots spaced 21 days apart. It is an mRNA vaccine. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides significant protection against serious illness.

As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine is delivered in one shot only. It is a viral vector vaccine. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 72% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides significant protection against serious illness. 
---
Yes. mRNA vaccines have been in development for years and have been proven to be safe and effective. They build immune protection by copying the shape of the virus without actually including a piece of the virus itself.

mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid and can most easily be described as instructions for how to make a protein, or even just a piece of a protein.

mRNA is not able to alter our genetic makeup (DNA). The mRNA from a COVID-19 vaccine does not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. Instead, COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA work with the body’s natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease.
---
As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. Doctors and other health experts are reviewing the specifics and will continue to provide the latest information.

CDC and FDA have noted that adverse events appear to be extremely rare. As of April 12, nearly 7 million J&J doses have been administered, and CDC and FDA are investigating 6 cases of an extremely rare type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine. People who have received the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine within the past three weeks who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath should contact their healthcare provider.

The CDC and FDA continue to recommend the Pfizer and Moderna versions of COVID-19 vaccines, and the United States has already secured enough Pfizer and Moderna doses for 300 million Americans.

Vaccine Finder is the most up-to-date national database of locations that offer COVID-19 vaccines. When you use the tool, make sure to note:

- You'll need to contact a location directly to book an appointment before going, either by phone or on their website (the Vaccine Finder tool does not allow for appointment booking, only finding locations where vaccines are being offered).
- You'll also need to first confirm that you are currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination in your state. To see if you are eligible, consult your state's current guidelines. Most states have these posted online. There are also other resources such as Plan Your Vaccine to help you get started.
- More data is being added every day about vaccination locations and availability. Since information might be limited in some states while more providers and pharmacies are being added, be sure to check Vaccine Finder regularly if you don't see available vaccines near you yet.
---
In the United States, everyone age 16 and over is currently eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
---
While supplies are limited, if you are in one of the groups recommended to take the vaccine, you will need to get whichever vaccine is available in your area. It’s possible that in the coming months, as production increases and more vaccines get approved for use, that people will have options for which shot to get.

The bottom line is that every vaccine that is recommended by FDA and CDC has been thoroughly tested and found to be effective and safe.

You’ll get a card or fact sheet at your vaccination site that will tell you about the vaccine and help you understand the details. Your card will tell you which kind of vaccine you get and when to get the second dose, if applicable.
---
COVID-19 vaccine is provided at 100% no cost to recipients. The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status. No one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay a vaccine administration fee.
---
All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States have been shown to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19.

Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given in two shots, one at a time and spaced apart. The second shot of the Moderna vaccine should be given 28 days after your first shot, and the second shot of the Pfizer vaccine should be given 21 days after your first shot. If you are told you need two shots, make sure that you get both of them. The different types of vaccine are not interchangeable, so your doctor or pharmacist will help make sure you get the same type of vaccine for both shots if applicable.

The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine only requires one shot. As of April 13, CDC and FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States out of an abundance of caution. Doctors and other health experts are reviewing the specifics and will continue to provide the latest information.

The vaccines may work in slightly different ways, but all types of the vaccines will help protect you. It takes time for your body to build immunity after vaccination, so you might not get full protection until two weeks after your final shot for two-dose vaccines, and your single shot for a single-dose vaccine.

Ask your healthcare provider about tools (like V-safe) that can send you automated reminders about getting your first and second shots at the appropriate time.
---
CDC does not require United States citizenship for individuals to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
---
Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will be a lot like getting any other shot.

When you go in, you’ll be given a fact sheet that tells you more about the specific vaccine you’re being offered.

Once you’ve had the vaccine, you will receive a vaccination card with the date, location, and type of vaccine you received. You might also get a card reminding you when to come back for the second shot if applicable.

The supply of vaccines will increase in the coming weeks and months. We expect several thousand vaccine providers across the country to offer vaccines — including doctors’ offices, hospitals, pharmacy chains like CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart, and certain other qualified healthcare centers.
---
It’s normal to experience some mild discomfort following a vaccine. This means it’s working and creating an immune response in your body.

You may feel soreness or experience some swelling in your arm. You may also feel tired, have a headache, fever, or chills. These symptoms do not mean you have COVID-19 — it’s not possible to get COVID-19 from the vaccine.

These side effects may impact your daily activities, but they shouldn’t last more than 2-3 days. If they continue or get worse, call your doctor, nurse, or clinic.

Even if you have these types of effects after your first shot, it’s important to make sure you get the second one, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get a second shot or you get the vaccine that only requires one dose. Ask your doctor if you have questions. Your body takes time to build immunity. You may not be fully protected against COVID-19 until 1-2 weeks after your final shot.

In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:

- If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours
- If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days
- If you develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within the first three weeks.
- If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions.
---
Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are extremely rare. The FDA says the authorized COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe for people with common food or environmental allergies.

CDC recommends that people get vaccinated even if they have a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectable medications—such as food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex allergies. People with a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of severe allergic reactions may also get vaccinated.

If you have had an immediate allergic reaction — even if it was not severe — to a vaccine or injectable therapy for another disease, ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. Your doctor will help you decide if it is safe for you to get vaccinated.

All people who get a COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored on site. People who have had severe allergic reactions or who have had any type of immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after getting the vaccine. All other people should be monitored for at least 15 minutes after getting the vaccine.
---
Yes. Until enough Americans are vaccinated, it’s important to continue to wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with, avoid crowds, and wash your hands frequently.

Researchers are working to understand whether you can still carry the virus and spread it to others if you’ve had the vaccine and are protected from getting sick.

Continuing to wear a mask helps protect others while we learn more about how COVID-19 spreads. It also helps protect people who are not able to get vaccinated — such as pregnant women or young children.
---
Current data suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines recommended in the United States provide protection against new forms or variants of the COVID-19 virus. For this reason, COVID-19 vaccines are an essential tool to protect people against COVID-19, including against new variants. CDC recommends getting vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is available to you.
---
At this time, the studies do not include pregnant women or young children, but testing with those groups will likely begin in the near future. Pregnant women who get infected with COVID-19 disease are more likely to have severe disease.

There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. There is also no evidence suggesting that fertility problems are a side effect of any FDA-authorized vaccine.

People who are pregnant and part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, such as healthcare personnel, may choose to be vaccinated. A conversation between pregnant patients and their clinicians may help them decide whether to get vaccinated.
---
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days, talk to your doctor about when you should get vaccinated. People who have already had COVID-19 should still eventually get vaccinated to ensure they are protected.

Over the next few months, with more and more people getting vaccinated, we will find out more about how the vaccines protect people who have already had COVID-19.

COVID-19 vaccination should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection. You should not be required to have an antibody test before you are vaccinated.

However, anyone currently infected with COVID-19 should wait to get vaccinated until after their illness has resolved and after they have met the criteria to discontinue isolation.
---
Fully vaccinated people (full immunity takes ~2 weeks after your final shot) can gather indoors, without physical distancing or wearing masks, with:

- Other people who are fully vaccinated

- Unvaccinated people from one other household, unless any of the people in that household has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

If you’ve been around someone who has COVID-19 after you’ve been vaccinated, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.

- BUT, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don’t have symptoms.

Until more is known, fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from other people in other settings, like when they are in public or visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households.
